Custom Skip
====

This version of CustomSkip should restore skipping on dynamic playlists with the Dynamic Playlists plugin version 3+.<br><br>
**I'm not maintaing CustomSkip nor am I providing any support for it.**


<br><br>

## Installation

* go to *settings > plugins* and uninstall the currently installed version of *Custom Skip*.

* then go to *settings > information*. Near the bottom of the page you'll find several plugin folder paths. The *path* you're looking for does **not** include the word *Cache* and it's not the server plugin folder that contains built-in LMS plugins. Examples of correct paths:
    * *piCorePlayer*: /usr/local/slimserver/Plugins
    * *Mac*: /Users/yourusername/Library/Application Support/Squeezebox/Plugins

* now click the green *Code* button and download the zip archive. Move the folder called *CustomSkip* from that archive into the plugin folder mentioned above.

* restart LMS
